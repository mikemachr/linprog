# Linear programming solver app
This web app uses SciPy's linprog.optimize function, its made for easily handling inputs for solving linear programming
problems in the form Ax=B,Ax>=B, and Ax<=B. 

Requirements are listed on requirements.txt

As of this moment the number of variables and restrictions cannot be ineractively changed, but this can be done changing the 
variables _N_vars and _N_rest on app.py=>index.
